Permaculture was introduced in Malawi at least beginning in the early-1990s. Since then, there have been at least 16 organizations whose personnel received permaculture training, 27 projects with a permaculture component, and 11 permaculture organizations. 

Permaculture training was the main component of 26 out of 27 projects, and 21 projects started permaculture demonstration gardens. Organizations have used permaculture in a variety of programs, such as part of school, health, livelihood, orphan care, refugee, and prison programs.
